        <h2>What is the Problem?</h2>
        <p>Ireland's transition to a greener and more sustainable transportation system faces significant challenges, particularly in promoting cycling as an alternative to car-based travel. Despite its environmental, health, and economic benefits, cycling adoption remains low among families and "tentative" cyclists due to safety concerns related to road infrastructure. Furthermore, the lack of systematic post-completion evaluations of new cycling infrastructure and insufficient collaboration between planners and cyclists hinders progress in creating safer and more effective cycling environments.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>What is the Solution?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provide Objective Data on Perceived Safety:</strong> Combine physiological data from cyclists with environmental factors (e.g., traffic, road layout, weather) to offer actionable insights into road safety.</li>
            <li><strong>Implement Post-Completion Evaluations:</strong> Introduce systematic evaluations of new cycle lanes to ensure they meet design objectives and function effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitate Collaboration:</strong> Establish frameworks for transport planners and cyclists to co-design and evaluate infrastructure projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Encourage Cycling Among Families and Tentative Cyclists:</strong> Enhance safety and accessibility to foster a cultural shift towards cycling as a primary mode of transportation.</li>
        </ul>
